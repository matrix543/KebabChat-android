KebabChat is a client for the matrix protocol, based on the SchildiChat and Element app.
The matrix protocol is a decentralized approach to modern messaging, allowing for end-to-end encryption, shared message history across multiple devices, and more.
By building on SchildiChat, Kebabchat inherits all features of one of the most complete and feature-rich Matrix-clients currently available.
On top, KebabChat adds a different design and various extra tweaks, customization options, and additional community features.

KebabChat is open source: https://github.com/SchildiChat/SchildiChat-android
